Artificial Intelligence Trading Bot using NEAT

What does this project do?
  This project aims to create a trading bot that uses NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies
to predict prices, place, and close orders for maximum profit and free families financially from economic slavery. Divorce is a pandemic because both parents are out working and not staying home to instill values into their children. Their children are seeking "family" through gangs, drugs, and other mischievious behaviors. We need to empower and bring parents home to their children to be a model and influence for their lives. 
  
Why is this project useful?
  This project is to develop using the strategies implemented in MarI/O teaching AI how to play a simple game. As mario jumps, its predicts and knows when to jump and avoid obstacles and appears to be no different than a stock/crypto price moving up and down. We'll modify the NEAT code to store the neurons into a mongoDB database to store and remeber what is learned over time. The connections to the database neuron will be real time using websocket connections. The work load of the calculation will be split and divided among many companies contributing towards a central neuron to gather all the connections of various indicatiors and output the predicted actions to open and close order, long or short, increase or decrease leverage, cancel an order, or take a loss, decide on the number of contracts and manage its own risk.

Where can I get more help, if I need it?

Positions to be filled
Project Manager - This will be a senior programmer who can review and commit code to the repository
Python Programmer - Takes on the sprints assigned to them
Bot Users - Provides user feedback and recommendations

This is my first open source project I'm organizing. I'm not a programmer but have programmed with some low code drag an drop plateforms like ubotstudio.com
I contribute through organizing a community of people discuss and provided a back log of features for the project. I also provide the idea, inspiration, and hosting of the project as well as the name, logo, and branding of the project. 

I'll commit more to the vision over time but currently we need to rewrite the code https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html with node red and enable the node red to store the neurons into mongod using websockets for real time connections https://nodered.org/ with a API marketplace using https://openchannel.io/ for other bot users to simulate and contribute the neural network. I forsee using the trained neurons for other applications such as solving real world engineering problems and collaboratively network with other already trained neurons to design and solve engineering problems.
